Self-taught programmer with no university degree. :sunglasses: <br/> I believe the current education system is outdated, and I prefer not to waste my time on empty titles.

Currently, I work at <a href="https://www.aloconcursos.com/">Al√¥ concursos</a> as the sole front-end developer, mostly using React, but I also create small Python applications for file extractions.

As a hobby, I enjoy exploring my Arch Linux and studying Japanese.
